# Elementa

**Elementa** is set to be a **Minecraft**—by Mojang™—duplicate or something similar to it. Primarily, this is serving as practice for me, **[devonk15](https://github.com/devonk15)** the main developer, to test my skills and seeing how well I can go about this, along with how far I can go.

If this gains support, I might make more versions, if I get a working version out to the people in the first place, but that is unclear if it will happen.

**Disclaimer: The Unknown Group and its projects are not affialiated, associated, approved by Mojang or Microsoft, nor are we an official Minecraft Service.**
